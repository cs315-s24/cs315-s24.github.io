## Requirements

1. You will develop RISC-V assembly language implementations of the following problems, and print the results to ensure that both the C implementation and your RISC-V implementation compute the correct answer.
1. Your executables must be named as follows, and must be compiled with a `Makefile`
1. We will test your projects using autograder

**to_upper**

Given a string of upper, lower, and non-alphanumeric characters, transform lowercase letters into uppercase letters.

    $ ./to_upper FooBar1
    C: FOOBAR1
    Asm: FOOBAR1

**max3**

Given three signed integer parameters, find the largest by comparing the first two, and then comparing the larger of those with the third. That is, max3_s must be implemented using two calls to `max2_s`.

    $ ./max3 2 4 6
    C: 6
    Asm: 6

**find_max_index**

Given an array of integers, return the index of the largest integer in the array

    $ ./find_max_index 5 4 3 2 1
    C: 0
    Asm: 0
    $./find_max_index 1 2 3 4 5
    C: 4
    Asm: 4

**sort**

Given the address of an array of unsigned integers, and the length of the array, sort the input array descending (largest to smallest) in place given the C implementation of the sorting algorithm. Your `sort_s` implementation must use `find_max_index_s`

    $ ./sort 10 30 20
    C: 30 20 10
    Asm: 30 20 10

## Given

1. The starter repo contains C implementations for each of the programs
1. Autograder test cases are available

## Rubric

1. 80 points: automated test cases
1. 5 points: clean repo (no build products) which compiles and links successfully
1. 15 points: code quality: consistent formatting, no dead or redundant code, no unnecessarily complex code, readable comments
